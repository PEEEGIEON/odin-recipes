    <p>California roll or California maki is an uramaki containing imitation crab, avocado, and cucumber.
    <br>Sometimes crab salad is substituted for the crab stick,
    and often the outer layer of rice is sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds or roe.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sushi rice</li>
      <li>Rice vinegar</li>
      <li>Crab Meat (Immitation works too)</li>
      <li>Avocado</li>
      <li>Cucumber</li>
      <li>Nori (Seaweed sheets)</li>
      <li>Optional: Toasted seasame seeds, spicy mayo</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook sushi rice and season with rice vinegar.</li>
      <li>While rice is cooking, slice avocado, cucumber, and crab into strips. Remove cucumber seeds.</li>
      <li>Lay plastic wrap on your sushi mat so the rice doesn't stick to the mat.</li>
      <li>On your sushi mat lay a half sheet of nori, spread rice on the nori leaving a small section uncovered on top.</li>
      <li>Flip the nori so the rice is face down, lay a strip of avocado, cucumber, and crab in the centre of the nori.</li>
      <li>Lift the bottom edge of the mat while keeping the fillings in place and roll the nori over.</li>
      <li>Squeeze to compress the fillings once it has been rolled.</li>
      <li>Use a sharp, wet knife to cut the roll into slices of desired thickness. Top with seasame seeds and/or spicy mayo.</li>
    </ol>
